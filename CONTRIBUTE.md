# Really? You want to help me... :blush:
I am pretty leanient about accepting pull requests.  Really anything you could help with, even if seemingly trivial, is a huge help.  
## Project goals
As far as I know, there is no really comprehensive python library for counting functions used in combinatorics.  You have stuff like `math.comb`, `math.perm` and `scipy.stats.binom.pmf`.  These functions are scattered throughout the python ecosystem and I just wanted a single simple library for students that is easy to use.
