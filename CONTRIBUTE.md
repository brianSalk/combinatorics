# Welcome to the Contributing Page
Interested in contributing?  The following are things I need the most help with:  
### add functions/classes
Am I missing one of your favorite combinatorics functions?  Submit a pull request and add it.  If you are feeling extra ambition you may add the description of your new function/class to the readme  
### improve descriptions and uses of functions
Some of my descriptions are not very good, I can also have more examples of when the function is used.  These additions can be added to the pydocs as well as the readme.
### improve and fix code
Just keep in mind the spirit of this project, we are trying to make the steps of the functions explicit, only calling functions that were defined elsewhere in the project (avoid external libraries if possible), and do not sacrifice clarity for performance.
